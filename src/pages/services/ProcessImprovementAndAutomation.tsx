            A business process is often started by a trigger, such as the filing
            of an expense report, which initiates a set of predefined workflow
            steps, or processes, that conclude with the employee receiving
            reimbursement. Our business improvement and automation solution
            provide for the assessment of existing process for improvement
            purposes as well as the transformation of operational processes from
            its human-centric stage to a highly automated state. The main
            objective of Business Process Improvement and Automation is not only
            to automate business processes, but also to simplify and improve
            business workflows as well. Business Process Automation can be a
            standalone initiative or part of a larger, overarching business
            process management strategy. Within the Business Process Management
            framework, automated business processes are managed collectively to
            improve an organizationâ€™s overall workflow in terms of; achieving
            greater efficiency, adapting to changing business needs, reducing
            human error and clarifying job roles and responsibilities. BPM is
            itself a subset of the entire infrastructure management system of an
            organization, which maintains and optimizes an organization's core
            operational components such as processes, equipment and data.
